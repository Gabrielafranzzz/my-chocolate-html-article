    <h1>Brazil</h1>
    <h2>The only country worldwide producing cocoa and consuming chocolate.</h2>
    <p>According to the Cocoa Barometer map published (<a href=“/Cocoabarometer2018_web4.pdf”>downloadPDF</a>) in 2017, Brazil:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>produced 189 tons of cocoa.</li>
      <li>consumed 165 tons of chocolate.</li>
    </ul>
    <a href=“#map.png”>MAP</a>
    <p>Best case cenario a Brazilian cocoa farmer is paid `R$ 10 per Kg`.</p>
    <p>In Europe, fortunately there is a law which does not allow chocolate to have less than 35% of cocoa in its ingredients. This is not the case in other countries! In Brazil is only 25%, but the there is almost no inspection on final products sold on the market.</p>
    <h3>Let's compare prices.</h3>

    <p>Brazilian farmers receive R$ 10 reais which in 2020 represents `less than 10%` of the final value.</p>
    <h3>The Cocoa Chocolate Value Chain has to change not only in Brazil, but Worldwide!</h3>
    <p>According to one study published in Brazil, between 2017 and 2018, three largest retail brands are responsible for 63.8% of chocolate sold in the country.</p>
    <p>These companies are controlling most part of the value chain. The Netflix series Rotten shows the dark side of consuming chocolate worldwide, this is also a reality in Brazil as these three control the most profitable part of the market.</p>
    <p>Watch the trailer: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbiWJbMJTQ"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ1NjlmMzAtOTNhMS00YmI1LWIyMzEtZGIzMTg2NGZlZmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_SX1777_CR0,0,1777,938_AL_.jpg" /></a></p>
    <p>BUT...</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There is a new concept named bean to bar, such as Tonny's, and it seems to be trending wordwide.</li>
      <li>This is happening also in Brazil. In the Amazon jungle!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>And the best is... Brazilian cocoa is reforesting the Amazon jungle.</h2>
    <p>Pará has a long-term strategic plan called Pró Cacau (<a href=“/ProjetodeCacau-formatado_final.pdf”>downloadPDF</a>) Programa de Desenvolvimento da Cadeia Produtiva no Estado do Pará, prepared by SEDAP. In 2015 on average cocoa farmers from Pará produced 903 kg of cocoa per hectare! </p>
    <p>According to the World Cocoa Foundation, the average in America is 500 to 600Kg per hectare.</p>
    <p>Font:<a href="https://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/">World Cocoa Foundation</a></p>
    <p>BUT HOW? Cocoa is original from the Amazon jungle, which explains the effective production, as well as other factors such as the development of collective regional cultivation.</p>
    <p>By consuming chocolate and all cocoa derivatives, consumer helps reforest the jungle, encouraging the production where cocoa is originally from, Amazonas.</p>
